Why it matters?

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

### Why should you care?

Many people ask me why should they care about their own privacy. It's not like they have anything to hide. That might be true. 

But, why should allowing people look at you be the default? Would you be comfortable to let anyone come into your home, install cameras to let the whole world have access to your lives? Would you keep your house doors unlocked?

Probably not. Even if you are not doing anything wrong in your houses. So, why would you let them look at your life all the time through your virtual windows? It is not that there is something to hide. It is why would I want my private life to be public? 

### Privacy speaks freedom. 

Humans are social beings. We care about what others think of us. We try to adjust our behavior depending on the social norms and others' feedback. Imagine yourself in the middle of a busy street full of people. Would you be as free as you would be in your house all by yourself? Probably not. Not only humans change their behavior in others presence but also the possibility of someone being present changes our behavior. You are your true self when nobody's looking and nobody could be looking; because you have the freedom to be so. You don't have to constantly adjust yourself in the fear of being judged.

Privacy brings freedom. I am free to have my life private, to have a pay where I can go and be free of the judgmental eyes. I am free to allow whomever I want (or no one at all) to monitor me. To be able to live freely as if no one is looking. To be my true self.

That freedom is taken away when privacy is taken away ( for e.g., via surveillance). Institutions want to be in control and the most effective way of being in control is to take away freedom. To force compliance of social norms and orthodoxy. To brainwash the members into believing what they want them to believe.

```**Side note**: Freedom as a virtue, frees one from the social norms and orthodoxies and nourishes creative open thinking.```

### What's the worst that could happen?

The world is full of ill-intended malicious people who wouldn't mind destroying someone else's life for their own benefit. All it takes is one mistake from innocent people being in the wrong place at the wrong time to screw them over.

Your information may end-up in a data breach with some foreign

Your information may be used against you by your government in order to gain political power. Think about the [social credit system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System). It is already being practiced in some countries. For e.g., let's say your country implements it and starts surveilling on you 24x7 and as an open-minded individual, you enter a discussion with your peers and talk against some things your government has done recently. There is a good chance that because once-upon-a-time you raised your voice against the government, you are denied flight tickets for your next vacation.

This again brings up my point on personal freedom. Privacy speaks freedom. The ability to criticize the government is the exact thing that keeps them in check. Taking away that ability by penalizing free speech takes away our freedom and restricts us

### The privacy paradox

Many people are indeed concerned about their privacy but behave as they didn't. This is known as [the privacy paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy#The_privacy_paradox). 

Humans are social beings and we seek others' approval. We have a need for others to know what we are doing, which is why we voluntarily publish information about us online. But as social beings, we also need to acknowledge that there are things which let our close ones, our psychologists, our physicians, our lawyers to know about us which we would never be willing others know. People easily say they don't value privacy while their actions negate their belief. 

Other reasons for the privacy paradox might be "finding it technologically difficult to take certain actions that disallow institutions to take advantage of it. Applications are purposefully designed to make it as difficult for a regular user as possible to care about their privacy by changing the default settings, which are often extracting as much of user's personal data as possible. Most users do not have the knowledge and experience to protect themselves.

To summarize, I would like to point you to the following TED talk which will hopefully fill-in the gaps I left unfilled.
