I once visited a local Caf√© and ordered Hot Chocolate. Didn't expect much of it and thought it would be one of those powdered ready-made Cocoa mix. I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious this hot chocolate was. So, I decided to make such hot chocolate myself and looked for recipes. 
But I couldn't find any raw Cacao without sugar. The 100% chocolates I could found after a lot of searching are

### Ingredients

- [ ] Cacao
- [ ] Milk
- [ ] Cream
- [ ] Spices (Optional)
- [ ] Orange Zest (Optional)
- [ ] Sugar or other sweeteners (Optional)

### Recipe

1. Take around 5 pieces of [cacao mass](https://amzn.to/3iFdGP6).

    {:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
    ![Sevenhills Cacao Mass]({{site.baseurl}}/images/recipes/hotchocolate/1.jpg){: width="50%" .shadow}
    {:refdef }

2. Add the cacao and heavy cream to a bowl on medium heat. The high fat in the heavy cream makes the Cacao flavor come out

    {:refdef }

3. Stir with a spoon (preferably wooden to not destroy the non-stick bowl) until it looks like this. At this point you have very thick Keto hot chocolate (more like a pudding) and you can already consume it this way.

4. For the drink, add milk while continuing to stir

    {:refdef }

5. Add a pinch of Chilli, 3 pinches of Cinnamon powder or one stick, 2 pinches of Cardamom or 2 pods and 3 Cloves. You can also add Orange Zest for a true mulled chocolate feeling. You can also optionally add sugar or any other sweeteners, depending on your taste.

    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/recipes/hotchocolate//spices.jpg){: width="50%" .shadow}
    {:refdef }

6. Let it simmer on low heat while stirring once in a while. The longer you leave it simmer, the thicker the hot chocolate becomes.

7. Enjoy!!
