But often times, wealthy people do not understand the hardships of the poor, not because they are bad but simply because they haven’t experienced what it feels like to be poor. In order to experience this, Muslims are required to give up their worldly conveniences and step in the shoe of a poor person. During the month of Ramadan, practitioners are required to abstain from food, water, bad speech and sex from dawn till dusk.1 Fasting during Ramadan teaches Muslims self-control, discipline, sacrifice, empathy and compassion for the less fortunate and encourages generosity towards the poor. Most Muslims donate a percentage of their income as the obligatory tax (Zakāt) to the poor.2 Ramadan also encourages Muslims to devote time away from worldly activities into devotion and worship by rewarding greater than usual good deeds. Both fasting during Ramadan and charity (per year) are two of the five pillars of Islam and are necessary.3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan#Fasting &amp;#8617; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat &amp;#8617; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam &amp;#8617;</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://zshn25.github.io/images/crater-1853110_640.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://zshn25.github.io/images/crater-1853110_640.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Compilation of 3D mesh models</title><link href="https://zshn25.github.io/compilation-3d-mesh-resources/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Compilation of 3D mesh models" /><published>2021-04-14T17:21:23-05:00</published><updated>2021-04-14T17:21:23-05:00</updated><id>https://zshn25.github.io/compilation-3d-mesh-resources</id><author><name>Zeeshan Khan Suri</name></author><category term="3d-mesh" /><category term="datasets" /><category term="computer-vision" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://deep-geometry.github.io/abc-dataset/assets/images/header.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://deep-geometry.github.io/abc-dataset/assets/images/header.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Practicing Gratitude</title><link href="https://zshn25.github.io/practicing-gratitude/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Practicing Gratitude" /><published>2021-04-11T17:21:23-05:00</published><updated>2021-04-11T17:21:23-05:00</updated><id>https://zshn25.github.io/practicing-gratitude</id><author><name>Zeeshan Khan Suri</name></author><category term="philosophy" /><category term="gratitude" /><summary type="html">I believe that most of us belong somewhere in the middle of this bell curve, which approximates how fortunate (in terms of many factors) people are. On one extreme are people who were born in extreme poverty without basic necessities, or with crippling physical and mental disabilities or during times of warfare and crisis or belonging to races/regions with extreme discrimination and injustice or have unfortunately undergone negative and life changing tragedies. On the other hand are the fortunate, with extreme amounts of wealth, health, freedom, luck, etc.. While most of us belong somewhere in the middle, we often question why are we not fortunate enough to be born in the richest, socially elite and forget than while belonging to the normal also means not belonging to the negative side.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://zshn25.github.io/images/flower-3175428_640.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://zshn25.github.io/images/flower-3175428_640.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Dihydrogen Monoxide - The Truth</title><link href="https://zshn25.github.io/dihydrogen-monoxide/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dihydrogen Monoxide - The Truth" /><published>2021-04-01T14:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-04-01T14:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://zshn25.github.io/dihydrogen-monoxide</id><author><name>Zeeshan Khan Suri</name><email>zshn25[at]gmail[dot]com</email></author><category term="external-link" /><category term="dhmo-conspiracy" /><summary type="html">Dihydrogen monoxide: is also known as hydroxyl acid, and is the major component of acid rain. contributes to the “greenhouse effect”. may cause severe burns. contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape. accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals. may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes. has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients. Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used: as an industrial solvent and coolant. in nuclear power plants. in the production of styrofoam. as a fire retardant. in many forms of cruel animal research. in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical. as an additive in certain “junk-foods” and other food products.
